            <h2>About Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy refers to energy that is generated from natural resources which are replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, geothermal heat, and more. As global energy needs grow, renewable sources have become increasingly important in reducing environmental impact, ensuring sustainable energy supply, and addressing climate change.</p>
